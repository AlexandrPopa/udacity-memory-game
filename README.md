# Memory game project

This is my memory game project for Udacity front-end developer nanodegree.

## Getting Started

If you want to run the game locally, clone the repo or download the zip file and open index.html.

### Playing the game

The game consists of 16 cards. Each card has its own pair and you should find the match for each one. The game ends when all cards have been matched and the pairs have been found.
